# PageRank Algorithm - Serial and Parallel Implementation
Overview

This repository contains implementations of the PageRank algorithm, a method used to rank web pages based on their importance. The project provides both serial and parallel versions of the algorithm to demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of parallel computing.

Features

Serial Implementation: A straightforward, single-threaded version of the PageRank algorithm.

Parallel Implementation: An optimized version utilizing multi-threading or distributed processing to handle larger datasets efficiently.

Performance Comparison: Measure and compare execution times for the serial and parallel approaches.

Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8 or higher

Required Python libraries (see below)
